		<h2>Blurring</h2>
		<p>
			Plugin to blur point data, such as health personal data, and get some statistics about this blurring.
		</p>
		<h3>Menu</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#blur">Blurring</a></li>
			<li><a href="#statistics">Statistics</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3 id="blur">Blurring</h3>
		<p>
			<img src='algo.png' /><br />
			1 : Creating a buffer (radius r)<br />
			2 : Random selection of a point in each buffer<br />
			3 : Creating a buffer around the new point with the same radius. The initial point is at a maximal distance 2r of the centroid of the buffer.<br />
			4 : Deleting the random point and the first buffer
			<br /><br />
			The envelope layer will force the algorithm to have an intersection between the centroid and this layer. This is like a mask.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
		<p>
			The plugin asks two layers :
			<ul>
				<li>The blurred layer</li>
				<li>A stats layer</li>
			</ul>
			The stats layer could be buildings for instance.<br/>
			With these two layers, the plugin will count the number of intersections between them and produces some stats. This is usefull if you want to rate your blurring.
